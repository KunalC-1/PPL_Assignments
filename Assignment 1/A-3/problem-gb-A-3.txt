A-3 Loops
---------

        Compile the following program (file A-3.c) and observe the dumps.

	Source file : A-3.c
	Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-3.c
	View result : vi -O A-3.c A-3.c.*.cfg
	Clear dumps : rm -f A-3.c.* A-3.o

Program
-------

        int main()
        {
    	    int sum = 0;
    	    int i, j;
    
    	    while(sum < 100) {
    		    sum = sum * 2;
    	    }
    
    	    for(i=0; i<25; i++) {
    		    for(j=0; j<50; j++) {
    			    sum = sum + i*j;
    		    }
    	    }
        }

Questions
---------

        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

Ans : Basic blocks corespond to while loop--> <bb2>,<bb3>,<bb4>
	Basic blocks for while loop are assigned first to the if gotos statement while
	 in case of if else statement they are assigned after if gotos statement.
        
	   2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

Ans : Basic Blocks of for loop--> <bb5>,<bb6>,<bb7>,<bb8>,<bb9>,<bb10> 
	First basic block is for initialization then after it is for checking condition
	using if gotos and then if condition is true then basic block is for increment.
	Nothing is special about it only basic block for increment and iniatialisation added.
