A-2 Conditional Jumps and Control Flow Graphs
---------------------------------------------

        Compile the following program (file A-2.c) and observe the GIMPLE dumps.

        Source file : A-2.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple A-2.c
        View result : vi -O A-2.c A-2.c.*.gimple
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-2.c.* A-2.o

Program
-------

        int Z;

        void f()
        {
	        int a, b, c;
	        a = Z;
	        if (a < 10) {
		        b = 5;
		        c = 17;
	        } else {
		        b = 6;
		        c = 20;
		        if (a == 0) {
			        c = 0;
		        }
	        }
	        Z = b * 10 + c;
        }
	

Questions
---------

        1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?
Ans :A) If blocks are broken into distinct sections of code and translated to if gotos ;else gotos statements. 
     B)In conditional gotos,temporary blocks are specified and 	unconditional gotos are filled with empty statements.
   
	2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.

            Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-2.c
            View result : vi -O A-2.c A-2.c.*.cfg
Ans : Yes. Control flow graph make it clear for understanding.
	  Cfg creates basic blocks sequentially starting from 1 and this make it easier
	` to understand as compared to gimple.
            
***Note***  From here  onwards we will only  look at passes from  "cfg" onwards,
            each of which uses a CFG-based representation using basic blocks.
            
            
Additional Problem
------------------

        Try to figure  out how GCC handles the  ternary operator [a ? b  : c] in
        GIMPLE.
Ans :Ternary operator expression is converted into an if statement with each branch assigning to the same temporary.
