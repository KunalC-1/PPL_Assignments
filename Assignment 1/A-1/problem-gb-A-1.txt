A-1 Declarations, Expressions, and Assignments
----------------------------------------------

        Compile the following program (file  A-1.c) and observe the GIMPLE dumps
        and answer  the questions below. If  you manage to finish  all questions
        quickly try to attempt the optional problem.

Questions
---------

        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
Ans : A)When multiple variables delcared on same line then each declaration is done as an independent 
	local variable declaration.First all declarations are done, then initialization of
	that variable takes place if any. 
	
	B)Declaration of global variable is not shown in GIMPEL as they are directly used in body. 

        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
Ans : A)Operations in GIMPLE can have at most one operation.So complex operations are broken into 
	simple by introducing temporary variables.Ex.
				temp = a * b 
				c = temp + 25
		,where temp is the temporary variable created.
 	B)When our expession is complex that cannot be solved easily.We can convert C expression to 
	abstact syntax tree and non leaf node correspond to either a local or temporary variable storage.
       
	 3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
	
Ans :	A)Floats are represented using exponential e(scientific notation).
	like 35613.14564 stored as 3.561314564e+4
	B)Float is first converted to integer using int and it is then 	assigned to temp variable
	 in case of global Z.
	
        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
Ans :   Reading/writing of global variables requires a memory load or store operations.
	In GIMPLE we can have atmost one operation ,the only type of  statements involving globals are 
	of the form "GLOBAL = LOCAL" or  "LOCAL = GLOBAL".
	This is because while local variables of a procedure can reside entirely in registers,every 
	read/write  to global variables must refer to main  memory as they can be accessed by  other entities.
          Hence,any operation on global variables (such as the increment shown  in this example) has to 
	go through an indirection of a temporary version of the global inside registers (as this temporary 
	value is not visible to I/O devices, etc).Global temporaries are named similar to the global 
	variable but with a numeric suffix.
----------------

        Try to understand the underlying GIMPLE representation by looking at the
        RAW dumps:

        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple-raw A-1.c
        View result : vi -O A-1.c A-1.c.*.gimple
